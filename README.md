# Face Emotion Recognition Using Machine Learning

## Description
This project detects and classifies human facial emotions using machine learning techniques.  
It can identify emotions such as **Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Neutral, Fear, and Disgust** from images or video streams.

The model is trained on publicly available facial emotion datasets and leverages classical machine learning algorithms to achieve reliable real-time performance.
